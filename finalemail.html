<h1 style="color:blue;">The book named for this man includes the statement that "Assyria [is] the rod of my anger," referring to Tiglath-Pileser III's invasion. Along with Micah, he discussed how nations will beat their swords into plowshares and not take up arms against each other. The Septuagint translation of his prophesy claims that a virgin will "conceive and bear a son" who was called Immanuel. For 10 points, name this prophet who warned Israel that its immorality would lead to an invasion, whose namesake book is found between the Song of Songs and Jeremiah.</h1>
